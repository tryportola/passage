# OpenAPI Generator Ignore File
# This file tells the OpenAPI generator which files to preserve during regeneration.
#
# Note: The current generation script only copies *.ts files from temp directories
# to src/generated/, so these files are already protected. This file exists for
# consistency with packages/sdk/ and as a safeguard if the generation approach changes.

# Package configuration
